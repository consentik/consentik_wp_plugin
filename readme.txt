Protect your business and build trust with your visitors using **Consentik**, the all-in-one privacy compliance solution for WordPress.

As global privacy regulations tighten, ensuring your website complies with laws like GDPR (Europe), CCPA (California), LGPD (Brazil), AAPI (Japan), and PDPE (Singapore) is no longer optional—it’s mandatory. Consentik simplifies this complex process, providing a robust, user-friendly interface to manage user consent and cookies effectively.

Consentik is built for modern compliance needs, featuring automatic integration with **Google Consent Mode V2** and full support for **IAB TCF v2.2**, making it the perfect choice for publishers and advertisers who need to maintain ad revenue while respecting user privacy.

### 🚀 Key Features

*   **Smart Cookie Consent Banner:** Display a fully compliant banner with clear "Accept" and "Decline" options, ensuring you capture valid explicit consent from your visitors.
*   **Granular Preferences Popup:** Empower users to manage their privacy preferences. The popup displays detailed categories and lists the specific cookies currently in use on your website.
*   **Easy Customization:** Match your brand identity seamlessly. Customize the banner’s text, colors, buttons, and position directly from the settings panel—no coding required.
